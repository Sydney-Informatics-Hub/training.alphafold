# Introduction to AlphaFold

AlphaFold is a groundbreaking artificial intelligence system developed by [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphafold) that focuses on predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins. Proteins are essential molecules in our bodies that carry out various functions, and their structure plays a critical role in understanding their behavior and function.

AlphaFold2 utilizes deep learning algorithms to analyze the amino acid sequence of a protein and predict its 3D structure accurately. By understanding the structure of proteins, scientists can gain insights into how they interact with other molecules, such as drugs, and how they function in biological processes. This knowledge can have profound implications for various fields, including medicine, drug discovery, and bioengineering.

The traditional methods for determining protein structures, such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, can be time-consuming and expensive. AlphaFold2 significantly accelerates this process by providing accurate predictions in a fraction of the time. Its predictions have shown remarkable accuracy, comparable to experimental methods.

By providing researchers with reliable protein structure predictions, AlphaFold2 has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of biology and accelerate scientific discoveries. It can aid in designing more effective drugs, understanding disease mechanisms, and developing enzymes for industrial applications. Ultimately, AlphaFold2's advancements in protein folding have the potential to transform multiple areas of research and have a profound impact on human health and well-being.

The original AlphaFold was introduced in 2018 and utilized deep learning techniques to predict protein structures. It made significant advancements in protein folding predictions compared to previous methods but still had limitations in accuracy.

[AlphaFold2, introduced in 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2), represents a major breakthrough in protein structure prediction. It incorporates novel algorithmic improvements and advanced machine learning techniques, including a deep neural network architecture, to significantly improve accuracy. AlphaFold2 achieved remarkable performance in the [Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) competition in 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6927249/), outperforming other methods and approaching experimental accuracy for many protein structures.

AlphaFold2 is much faster than its predecessor. The original AlphaFold required significant computational resources and time to generate structure predictions. In contrast, AlphaFold2 is significantly optimized and can deliver predictions within a matter of days, or even hours, for many proteins. Moreover, AlphaFold2 has been designed with scalability in mind. It can efficiently utilize distributed computing resources, enabling multiple protein structure predictions to be processed simultaneously.

AlphaFold2 incorporates an attention mechanism that allows it to focus on relevant parts of the protein sequence when making predictions. This attention mechanism provides insights into the model's decision-making process and makes it more interpretable than the original AlphaFold.


## Manual Database Search

The [AlphaFold2 Protein Structure Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) is accessed through a web browser, allowing users to submit protein sequences and receive predicted structures via an online interface. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface that makes it accessible to non-experts and researchers without extensive programming or command line experience.

The AlphaFold2 Protein Structure Database is primarily intended for users who want to obtain protein structure predictions quickly and conveniently without the need for complex setups. Users can submit protein sequences, and the database provides predicted structures as outputs. It offers a straightforward interface with pre-defined settings and options.

## Automation

The command line AlphaFold2 application is a software package that runs on a local machine or server. It is designed for advanced users and researchers familiar with command line interfaces and programming. It requires installation and configuration, but it offers more flexibility and control over the prediction process.

It is customizable and allows researchers to fine-tune the prediction process according to their specific requirements. It provides a wide range of command line options and parameters that can be modified to optimize predictions. This level of control is beneficial for researchers who want to experiment with different settings or integrate AlphaFold2 into their existing computational pipelines.

This course is aimed at researchers seeking to automate their use of AlphaFold. See the following pages for examples for how to use AlphaFold in different conditions and on different systems. Whilst these are targetted for Sydney University researchers, others may benefit from the general routines.

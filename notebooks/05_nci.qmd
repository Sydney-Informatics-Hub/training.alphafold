# Running AlphaFold on NCI Gadi HPC

## NCI Gadi

The [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold) version of AlphaFold is available on NCI's Gadi.
Gadi is more than 10x larger than Artemis, so offers potentially far more significant resources.

Gadi uses a general architecture similar to Artemis so any workflows you have developed can be readily adapted to run on Gadi.

Usage and example PBS jobscripts for AlphaFold are well-documented here:
[NCI Help - Colabfold](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Colabfold)

You may also shift your Singularity images and workflows to Gadi.

For access to NCI, see [https://nci.org.au/users/how-access-nci](https://nci.org.au/users/how-access-nci) or contact sih.info@sydney.edu.au

Once you have an account you will need to join the "Colab Fold Project - *if89: Australia BioCommons Tools and Workflows*".

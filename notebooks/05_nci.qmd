# Running AlphaFold on NCI Gadi HPC

## NCI Gadi

The [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold) version of AlphaFold is available on NCI's Gadi.
Gadi is more than 10x larger than Artemis, so offers potentially far more significant resources.

Gadi uses a general architecture similar to Artemis so any workflows you have developed can be readily adapted to run on Gadi.

Usage and example PBS jobscripts for AlphaFold are well-documented here:

You may also shift your Singularity images and workflows to Gadi.

This is a training course aimed at users wanting to learn about [AlphaFold](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2) to perform predictions of protein structures. Beyond an introduction to the capabilities of AlphaFold, topics will cover different techincal approaches to run AlphaFold including using High Performance Computing and Cloud environments.

## Course pre-requisites and setup requirements

No previous programming experience is required, this training course will introduce you to fundamental Unix and HPC as required. Training will be delivered online, so you will need access to a modern computer with a stable internet connection. Participants will require the Sydney VPN and a terminal client (as per the [Setup Instructions](./setup.html) provided).


## Venue

Online via Zoom, a link will be shared with registered participants.

#### Zoom etiquette and how we interact

Sessions will be recorded and added to this page. Please interrupt whenever you want! Ideally, have your camera on and interact as much as possible. There will be someone monitoring the chat-window for any questions you would like to post there.  Extending for a three-hour duration, our Zoom session incorporates regular breaks and a blend of demonstrative and hands-on material.
